Collaborated with other teaching assistants and faculty members to transition the introductory class for electrical and systems engineers to a fully online format for the 2020 fall semester, revamping labs and class structure for over 40 students. As one of the teaching assistants, I was responsible for designing labs dedicated to introducing students to IoT technologies through Arduino and the Blynk platform.
