My name is Enzo Bergamo, and I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the <a href='https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu'>Operations, Information & Decisions</a> 
department of the <a href='https://www.wharton.upenn.edu'>Wharton School</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I have received my 
Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Systems Science & Engineering at the <a href='https://www.seas.upenn.edu/'>University of 
Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> where I was a <a href='https://global.upenn.edu/isss/penn-world-scholars'>Penn World Scholar</a>.

My interests lie in the areas of market design and the applications of machine learning to operations management and economics problems.
