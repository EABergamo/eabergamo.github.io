As a teaching assistant, I conducted biweekly office hours (âˆ¼ 100h/semester) for over 200 students in the introductory computer science class at Penn both while online due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in-person. Additionally, I provided assistance and developed content (worksheets, presentations) for students that required additional support during special Sunday Review Sessions in order to assist with the class content.
