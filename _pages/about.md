 Welcome to my website! My name is Enzo Bergamo, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Systems Science & Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I currently live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My interests lie in areas such as machine learning, data visualization, optimization, as well as the application of these topics in different ways.
