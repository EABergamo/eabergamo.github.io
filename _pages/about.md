 Welcome to my website! My name is Enzo Bergamo, and I am [Penn World Scholar](https://global.upenn.edu/isss/penn-world-scholars) currently pursuing both a Bachelor's Degree and a Master's Degree in Systems Science & Engineering at the [University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/). I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I currently live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My interests lie in areas such as machine learning, data visualization, optimization, as well as the application of these topics in different ways. If you would like to chat, feel free to send a message to ebergamo [at] seas [dot] upenn [dot] edu!
